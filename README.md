# IMPEXTECH 💻📱
**IMPEXTECH** is a custom built e-commerce platform designed to manage the retail operations of a high-spec gadget brand. This project serves as both a functional business tool and a demonstration of back end engineering principles using the Node.js ecosystem.

* **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js

* **Database**: MongoDB via Mongoose (NoSQL)

* **Environment**: Developed on macOS
